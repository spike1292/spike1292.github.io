![Henk Bakker]({{ site.picture }})

<p>Hi, I'm Henk Bakker a developer from the Netherlands. Currently I'm working as a consultant for <a href="https://codecask.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeCask</a></p>

<p>I started as a Backend developer, focusing on the language Java. As the market changed and required more Frontend developers, I adapted my skillset and broadened it with JavaScript, HTML5 an CSS. As a Frontend developer with a Backend background, I combine the design principles commonly used in the Backend, with the a-sync responsive nature of the Frontend. As a perfectionist, I'm always searching for new technologies able to create even stronger and better applications. </p>
